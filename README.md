# valentines-day

To my beautiful girlfriend:

I love you so much Khadija, you are the most amazing girlfriend I could ever ask for.

This isn't exactly the gift you would expect but it's something that will be here forever, your parents will never find it, and every Valentines day, something new will be put here.

This website is pretty boring since there's nothing really on it, but there's a reason for that.

This isn't just a one time gift, instead it's a new kind of memory box for you. One that has memories from the both of us, to remind us of all the silly wacky goofy things we do together.

As time goes on, we can add things to this page. We can add the pictures we take of each other, the videos of the minecraft server, or even just write down silly things we did together.

I love you so much Khadija, happy Valentines Day.
